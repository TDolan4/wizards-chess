This is my final group project for CS/DS 579 at UW-Madison. Initially this project was intended for VR, but then Covid hit and we no longer had access to the VR equipment. We had to adapt the game to be playable on PC with simple mouse and keyboard controls.

I was the lead programmer for this project. The code that I wrote is included in this repository as well as two documents. Project Pitch and Documentation details what we set out to create. Final Project Presentation includes credits, a description of the project, problems we had along the way, and instructions on how to operate the game.
